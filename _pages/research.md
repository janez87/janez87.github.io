Data-intensive systems applied for the social good may have unforeseen impacts on society. To take social impact into account, we need to develop **human-centered design approaches** that work at a **large scale**, are **data-driven**, and can **fully capture the diverse and complex landscape of peopleâ€™s needs, interests, and values**.

My work will focus on the integration of computational methods and human intelligence to understand how to  make design processes of data-intensive systems more scalable, efficient, effective, and sustainable (in terms of impact on society), without ignoring their data-intensive nature and keeping the human in the loop. This includes investigating how to integrate different kinds of data (from social media, sensors, lab studies, clinical trials, interviews, etc..), how to embed computational methods in a usually human-driven process (or vice-versa!), and how to provide trustworthy human-machine interactions.

A crucial aspect of my approach is to develop co-design methods and tools to elicit **empathy** among stakeholders to establish trust and form sustainable relationships. This is particularly true in the design of machine-based solutions to societal problems - such as healthcare -  where not only is it paramount to develop effectively and efficiently, but also understand the full extent of such systems in society. To do so, there is a novel **digital-supported methodologies** that aid the elicitation and integration of human needs in human-centered design approaches through the development of **empathetic relations**.
