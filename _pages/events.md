## Talks

#### Artificial Intelligence for Representative Democracy
On the 16th February 2022 I organized a special session on the usage of AI for representative democracy at the AMS Scientific conference. The goal of this session was to bring together academics, professionals, and policymakers to discuss how can we solve the digitalization imbalance by helping the elected representatives carry out their responsibilities using artificial intelligence-based solutions.

#### How can social (big) data be used to understand and help vulnerable young people?
On the 10th of October 2019 I gave a presentation for the Rotterdam Knowledge Lab of Urban Big Data on my work where I explored if and how new sources from the internet could complement conventional sources to study NEETs.

## Workshops

#### Empathy-Centric Design: Scrutinizing Empathy Beyond the Individual (CHI2024)
Empathy in HCI research is gaining attention, yet the research primarily focuses on “perspective-taking” in technology design for users’ subjective experiences and contexts. However, the depth of empathy extends to collective experiences influenced by digital environments and non-human interactions. In our third EmpathiCH workshop, we will reassess HCI’s focus on empathy in design and explore diverse empathy dimensions.

#### Empathy-Centric Design at Scale (CHI2023)
While HCI and design research acknowledged the importance of empathy to the design of user-centered technologies and services, there remain open questions about: assessing empathy, its diversity, and related tensions. In this one-day interactive workshop, we will consolidate existing theories and conceptualization of empathy, coalesce them to form a comprehensive and coherent framework, scrutinize the seams, and examine the overarching attributes of Empathy-Centric Design

#### Empathy-Centric Design at Scale (CHI2022)
We aims to bring together different scholars—including computer scientists, social scientists, designers, psychologists, policy-makers, and practitioners from other disciplines—to share their knowledge, experience, and ideas about working with empathy for large-scale societal impact. The motivation behind this works lies in the necessity of new digital-supported methodologies to design at-scale solutions to societal problems that are balanced, inclusive, and aware of their effect on society.
