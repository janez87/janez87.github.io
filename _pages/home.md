Hi all! I'm Andrea Mauri, a Junior Professor (Chaire de Professor Junior) at [Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/), affiliated with the [LIRIS Research Lab](https://liris.cnrs.fr/). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher within the [Knowledge and Intelligence Design Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/afdelingen/sustainable-design-engineering/kind/) at the [Sustainable Design Engineering Department](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ide/about-ide/departments/sustainable-design-engineering/) at the Delft University of Technology and a Research fellow at the [Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions](https://www.ams-institute.org/).

I obtained my PhD at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) with the thesis “Methodologies for the development of crowd and social-based applications”, where I contributed to the conceptual models and the concrete prototype of a general framework supporting the design, deploy, and monitoring of applications on top of crowd and social network based systems.

My [research](/research/) lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Data Management. I'm interested in investigating how to integrate **human perspective** and **computational methods** in the design, development and deployment of **data-intensive** applications -- with a special focus on the health domain -- with the goal of making them efficient, effective, and aware of people characteristcs, needs, and values.
